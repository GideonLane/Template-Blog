                <p class="blog-1">
                    Honestly it was tough. It was my first experience in a actually school enviorment because I was home schooled all the way to graduation.
                    It was a full online one month program that felt like a second full time job. What made this so hard was it was very intense and fast paced, 
                    I had a wife and a one year old at the time but in some ways this also made it even more fufilling. My wife was very supported by going the 
                    extra mile by taking care of our one year old almost completely, keeping the house clean and food on the table to give me the time to practice 
                    and time to study so she also had two full time jobs.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    Overall it was completely worth it and we have full intentions of taking their 5 month program on javascript, react.js, and cloud storage to further
                    my potetial as a web developer. Until then i'll be focasing on template design, freelance web development, and blogging and maybe some self teaching
                    on javascript to get a head start.

                <h1 class="blog-header">Week 1</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                        Week one was probably the easiest. I knew html fairly well for someone who was self taught but it was still worth it because it 
                        showed me some bad habbits I created and really sped me up on some of the production with understanding the difference between 
                        simatic and non-simanic tags. Also shortcuts is a great friend.
                </p>
                    <p class="blog-1">
                        Git Hub and GitBash was probably my biggest struggle in the week one leading into week 2 in the program. I already had a GitHub account
                        because I read that it was nessisary but I never did figure out why. Now that I know I understand it enough to create repositories and commit 
                        to a main branch I'm able to keep better track of my work without worrying about completely ruining a project. I have a project open and I decide
                        to try something to see how it worked and if it doesn't go well, instead of commiting go back to a previous commit and go from there. Its like 
                        having a saved video game file.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-1">
                        They didn't touch on css really any in the first week but I knew css fairly well so I wasn't overly concerned with it. Since they where focused on html 
                        I stuck with understanding as much as the foundationals they where teaching in html.

                <h1 class="blog-header">Week 2</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    Week 2 was alot of fun for me. I love css and all of its potential. Although they kept it pretty basic when it came time to submit homework I'm sure my 
                    teacher was suprised to some degree. I had a pretty well written css file overall. My only problem was I had alot of repeat codes that would of done 
                    well to learn shortcuts and adding styles to multiple tags more properly. So it was still very helpful in making my css more proficient.
            </p>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    There are some more struggles I had with css and I had no idea that the following week was gonna completely demolish my ability to right css freely and 
                    that took a hard turn for me. But Ill get to that in a moment.
                </p>
                <h1 class="blog-header">week 3</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    Week three was an absolute nightmare to everything I thought I would be learning. Bootstrap. I hated it so much at the start. I found it extremely confusing and 
                    could not figure out what was making my stylesheets bonky with it. I started using id selectors alot to overide my issues with it but that wasn't a good fix and 
                    I knew that. I didn't know what else to do. My dream css stylesheet was destroyed. I struggled with this until the day before the weekly class. Once I got a little
                    better handle on it and had a fellow student (who was very proficient in bootstrap) I started to enjoy how fast it was and how much you really can do with it. Styling 
                    issues subsided and my production level increased drasticly. Now I absolutely love bootstrap.
            </p>
                <h1 class="blog-header">week 4</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    Week 4 was interesting. Not at all What I thought it would be. It touched on sass styling a little bit but not as much as I would have liked. It primarly focused 
                    on more bootstrap resources and overall launching through firebase. I still dont know what all goes into firebase. There is probably a lot of cool features it has 
                    that I'm completely unaware of at this time of this blog. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    And what is a JSON file? I still dont get that. I just know what to do with it and how to make it do what its supposed to do. They didn't explain that very much.
                    Just only that I need it to launch. Should I gitignore it? Everywhere I look says you dont need to but should you is my question. Whats professional? I got nothing. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    After week 4 I feel much more confident in my abilites with decoding, building, launching, and documenting code in a readable, modifiable fasion. I have a log way to go 
                    but I'm enjoying every moment of it. I hope to have more oppurtunities to collaborate one day especially in the work field. Overall my experience with Nucamp was everything 
                    I needed to get a chin up and a nose dive into what I'm searching for.
