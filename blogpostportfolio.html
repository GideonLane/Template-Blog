                <h1 class="blog-header">Portfolio Website</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    Build my person website really took a long time. I must have rebuilt it more times than I can count. I even decided to rebuild the entire 
                    website using bootstrap instead of @media queries in honor of my new love for bootstrap. I feel a need to rework my website as of now because I feel like 
                    the about page isn't really showing a great portfolio atmosphere and I don't want my future clients or potential employers to have to go to another page 
                    to my portfolio. Resume needs work as well. I also would love to know enough PHP to build a backend for a form to direct to my email so that a potential 
                    employer can just do a short forum to have me contact them later if thats convient for them. As of now this is the construction of my website currently and 
                    why I built it the way I did and one day when I reconstruct it will show new content. Until then check out the process below.

                <h1 class="blog-header">html header and footer</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    I built the header and the footer together in one sitting as well as styling because I knew I would end up copying it alot on the other pages and wanted 
                    to minimize the css as much as possible so I made it compatible with the other pages in mind. I used bootstrap 5 for the dynamic components for the website 
                    to make it as user friendly but also to be able to build it as fast as possible because I didn't know javascript well enough to actually use it effeciently.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    overall I didn't find it too challenging to do because I've made more nav bars than anything else with html and css. I was able to just build it very quickly.
                    maybe twenty minutes? The footer took a little longer as I had to figure out the best way to use my row and col containers and also give it classes that made 
                    sense for styling purposes.

                    The design I wrote on paper first with containers and tags all labeled. It was a jumbled mess to anyone who saw it and I refuse to show it  here but it did the trick for me.
                    I've always been a pen and paper guy. I chose the dark deep ocean like blue because it was my favorite color and felt it offered a good balance between dark and light mode.
                    I chose the orangish yellow because I like the idea of it being like a deep ocean with a sunrise as the accent.

                        There has got to be a better way to design a logo. Really. That was alot of hard work. I basicly did css art and took a picture of it. That can't be the most proffesional way 
                        but it was all I knew at the time. I think it came out well. It will give me some trouble concerning redesigning my website because its a image with the background color and size it 
                        needs for this specific website nav bar. A problem for another time perhaps.

                <p class="blog-1">
                    I found that having multiple stylesheets is helpful but also confusing. For all my pages I put the same stylesheet linked to the base stylesheet page 
                        to keep everything as consistant as possible and used it primarly for anything that was used more than once with comments labeling each section beginning. 
                        After that each page has its own stylesheet but kept very short. This makes modifying in the future much easier as if its dedicated to the specific page 
                        I can go to that specific stylesheet. If its a universal style for the entirety of the web page I can go to the base stylesheet.
            </p>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    The var color variables are universal to all the pages I found out as long as it also has that stylesheet linked to the html page. I found this awesome. 
                        It made far less repeat code and now I can call upon that variable at any given page as long as the universal stylesheet was linked as well. Pretty cool.

                <h1 class="blog-header">clamping Text Sizing</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    I had alot of trouble getting my text components and containers to size correctly with bootstrap. I'm sure there is a way to do it but I did a little research becuase I 
                    felt that @media queries where abit intense for just some texts and found that clamp is absolutely amazing. It allows for consistant font-size changes as the screen changes 
                    sizes which was perfect. My containers would resize just fine but on the way to its size it would break several times doing all kinds of strange movements before
                    reverting to the correct size. Clamp was a automatic fix.
            </p>
                <h1 class="blog-header">@media Queries</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    I still had to use my good ole favorite for dynamic changing with @media queries. I just couln't get some of my containers to size the way I wanted them too with bootstrap.
                    perhaps there is a way I haven't learned about yet but no ammount of research was getting me closer to the answer of using bootstrap for some of my components. I dont think 
                    its bad practice to use @media queries, calc, or clam just because your primarly using bootstrap but Ill find out later.

                    Launching the project was something else. I ran into all kinds of problems. It was as if it was launched but wouldn't show any content. It was defaulted white page with a welcome 
                    forum from the firebase website. This took me about a week to overcome. My first problem was in my JSON file. I needed to change my destination from main to source and change my 
                    html page to index.html. I didn't realize that my html page had to be named index. I remember fixing it and it still not showing the content till about two days later. I guess it took time.
                    I have no explination for that.

                    My portfolio page had many challenges. The things I struggled with where the things I thought I finally understood and the things that came easy where the things I didn't know how 
                    to do fluently. Overall I enjoyed the process. With every project there is something to learn from.
