                <h1 class="blog-header">Slithering my way into Coding</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                        I started with just doing research on my laptop at work on the career choices they had available at my disposal. I looked at everything
                    from healthcare, construction, project management and technology. I never considered myself a techy guy but after deep diving into every 
                    topic I found that the only option that seemed even remotely interesting to me was the Web Development. I'm a relativly artys, poetic, 
                    but also meticulous thinker who actually enjoys running into a problem that I need to solve with extensive research. 
                </p>
                    <p class="blog-1">
                        So I did research on the easiest first coding language to start with and the majority of votes went to Python. 
                    I didn't know the difference between front-end or back-end yet or any terminology for that matter but I dived right in 
                    and started following brief tutorials and reading alot on workflow forums.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-1">
                        After just tinkering with creating variables and doing basic arithmatics I had an idea of a virtual beach sign on a australian beach 
                    (the kind that has texts that animated from right to left continuasly) that told you the conditions of the weather for surfers. I had a much
                    bigger idea than what I actually built. I wanted it (and still may build it in the future) to display more than just what to do with the 
                    weather conditions. I originally wanted it actually very complex, adding tempature report, uv meter, and a whole bunch more. I just didn't realize
                    that you couldn't create anything visual with python alone. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-1">
                        There did come a point where I had trouble with the code exicuting properly. My wife was just sitting on the sofa while I was very verbually trying
                    to solve whatever was causing the break on line 3. She came to hover over my shoulder for a bit and pointed out that if I wanted it to work like the 
                    rest of "if" statements I needed to make them all the same. I was missing the umlaut at the end of line 3. Now that I see what was missing 
                    it should of been obvious. Lesson take away, never be ashamned to ask for help and when you find the solution your reward is the best feeling ever.

                <h1 class="blog-header">First Online Class</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    After falling in love with Python and the potential I felt I had in that moment I looked up free classes online on whatever I could find.
                    Without even knowing that a free online demo class I signed up for was for a bootcamp called Nucamp I attended late at night after work. 
                    I had no idea what to anticipate. I hoped it didn't require any software downloaded (didn't even know about code editors yet) but I attended as I was.
                    pjs on and a can of soda in hand.
            </p>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    The class was on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoyed it even mroe than Python because artisticly, I'm very visual. 
                    It made all the difference in the world that what I was coding was displaying something visually. Instead of a code editor installed (They never even mentioned a code editor)
                    they set us up using a website called CodePen. This helped me alot as well as it had alot of awesome references to what was actually possible with code. 
                    I was fasinated by the idea of css art so I started with just using div containers to create small things. This gave me good foundation on properties like 
                    z-index, display, margin, padding, and sizing as well as creating shapes with transform, and radius. If your ever thinking about trying to learn the basics of coding,
                    just jump into whatever interests you most and follow the trail.
                </p>
                <h1 class="blog-header">CodePens</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    <a href="https://codepen.io/" class="link" target="_blank">CodePen</a> is an amazing source for learning and practicing without getting over techy. So if your a beginner and just want to dabble at first this is a fantastic way to start.
                    I probably did that way too long. I didn't look up tutorials for a long time and never noticed the existance of a code editor (not my best research I guess)
                    but I did learn a ton from looking at others code and gave me endless ideas on building with html and css. When I made the decision to start looking up tutorials and do more 
                    reading on how to do it more profesionally I chose <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" class="link" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> as my code editor because it seemed to be the most popular.
            </p>
                <h1 class="blog-header">HTML and CSS</h1>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    Once I understood how Visual Studio Code worked in addition to its potential with extensions I dove deep and started trying to build websites. I really struggled to understand dynamic.
                    I actually quit for about a month just because I couldn't figure out why when I zoomed in on the page or made my page smaller would completely disorientate my projects. 
                    I knew it couldn't be right because websites that we visit all the time never break appart like that. After playing with @media queries I got a better understanding what was going on
                    but I took forever understanding the importantance of div containers being exact on start to end and wether it should be in a container or more than one.
                    I also never understood the concept that a div container inheritly has no value. I did get close to understanding this to some degree and was able to make at least somewhat decent projects
                    but I knew something was missing.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    After about 9 solid months of only HTML and CSS I made the decision to invest in education. I had career options from work but I wasn't ready to commit to a college level
                    computer science degree yet so I looked up bootcamps. I remembered the first class I took was a demo to Nucamp so I took a look at all of there programs.
                    I settled on the first program recomended, HTML and CSS Web Fundamentals. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-1">
                    The class was amazing. My instructor was very responsive and clearly dedicated to his students. I've heard mixed reviews on instructors. Seemed like it was a 
                    hit or miss situation. Looks like I hit. Having a proper instuctor and being a part of a community with the same goals in mind made me take a huge leap from 
                    self studying and fighting every step of the way to a clear, dynamic atmospere that promoted learning. It was very fast paced but worth every minute of hard work.
                    I still think its great to self study in the beginning to see how well you research and to get a feel for how it all comes together but I will always recommend that 
                    at somepoint if you want to take it to a career level, go to a bootcamp that teaches exactly what your shooting for and if your dedicated, if you put in the work,
                    you will see what your made of.
